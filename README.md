# Flappy_Jump-Old-Project-
This is a pygame project from when I was learning coding for the first time

Flappy_Jump is a early project of mine. I was trying to build flappy bird with a tutorial, but then I realized I I don't like flappy bird. So, I tried to create doodle jump clone with flappy jump assets. This is the unfinished version of this project.
